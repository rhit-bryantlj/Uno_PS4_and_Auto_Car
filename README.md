# Uno_PS4_and_Auto_Car
This repository houses the development and final code for an Arduino Uno developed autonomous car. This car autonomously follows a line around a track and flashes codes using a transmitting LED. The car will then enter controlled mode and receive signal from a Playstation bluetooth controller for operation.

The car utilized an Arduino Uno with peripherals including servos, transmitting and receiving LEDs, RGB LEDs, and Bluetooth dongle. The dongle would connect with a Playstation controller and be controlled using the PSx library.
